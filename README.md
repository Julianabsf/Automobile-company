# Automobile-company

On this project, I used Automobile company data to segment its customers. The first step was to perform an EDA to better understand Autoshop customers, in general. Then, I used an unsupervised machine learning model(KMeans) to create the clusters. In each group, you can find the profile of the most predominant characteristics of the customers. With this segmentation, the business sector can develop strategies to attract more customers or even define a better place to settle a new Autoshop.
